Antiword: a free MS Word document reader

# History
This repo is a "fork" of the sources once found at
http://www.winfield.demon.nl/.  This website has been unavailable for
several years, and to the best of my knowledge and search attempts no
other location exists for the sources of antiword.

In this repo, old versions -- as far as I could go back -- were
imported, and then some patchs that exist for antiword were applied.

The last state of the original antiword website can be found via the
wayback engine:

# Summary
Antiword is a free MS Word reader for Linux and RISC OS. There are ports
to FreeBSD, BeOS, OS/2, Mac OS X, Amiga, VMS, NetWare, Plan9, EPOC,
Zaurus PDA, MorphOS, Tru64/OSF, Minix, Solaris and DOS. Antiword
converts the binary files from Word 2, 6, 7, 97, 2000, 2002 and 2003 to
plain text and to PostScript TM.

# On MS Word document readers
Microsoft® Word only exists on platforms supported by Microsoft itself.
On other platforms, reading Microsoft® Word files is usually difficult,
sometimes expensive and often impossible.

I am busy writing a Microsoft® Word reader for Linux and RISC OS. This
Microsoft® Word reader is called Antiword for reasons explained in the
documentation.
Antiword is a work in progress and many features are still being
developed. However, Antiword is usable on all but the most complex Word
documents.
