History of AntiWord by © Adri van Os
------------------------------------


The Name
--------
The name comes from: "The antidote against people who send Microsoft® Word
files to everybody, because they believe that everybody runs Windows® and
therefore runs Word".


Version 0.31 (08 Dec 2000)
--------------------------
Early beta release, for evaluation by the public.


Known Limitations
-----------------

1) The layout of Word files is kept "secret" by Microsoft®. Therefore
   AntiWord is based on information gathered from the Internet and on
   guesswork.
2) AntiWord doesn't show all the pictures included in the Wordfile.
3) AntiWords can not deal with very large files. The current maximum size
   of an inputfile is about 7 MB.
4) AntiWord doesn't do any hyphenation. It doesn't because hyphenation is
   language dependant.
5) AntiWord doesn't try to emulate any of Words DTP abilities.
6) The error messages from AntiWord are not very helpful.


Known Bugs
----------

1) AntiWord can not handle encrypted documents.
2) AntiWord assumes default tabstops.
3) AntiWord doesn't handle sections, styles, frames.
4) AntiWord ignores pages headers and footers.
5) AntiWord adds numbers to all the headers instead of selectively.
6) AntiWord only handles lists in some of the styles in Word 6 and Word 7
   and does not handle lists at all in Word 97 and 2000.
