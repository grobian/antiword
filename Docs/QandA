Questions and Answers (RISC OS version)
=======================================

Q1: How do I install AntiWord?
A1: Copy the application-directory and all the files within it to a
    suitable directory.

Q2: How do I use AntiWord?
A2: Double click on a Wordfile, filetype MSWord (&ae6). Or drag and drop
    a file onto the AntiWord icon on the iconbar.

Q3: How does AntiWord deal with Word macro viruses?
A3: AntiWord does not run any Word macros because it can not do so.
    Therefore your Archimedes will not be harmed by such a virus.

Q4: What does the 'Paragraph breaks' option do?
A4: This option controls the maximum number of characters per line in
    paragraphs. If your screen is 640 pixels wide (like modes 20 and 27)
    than 76 is probably best. If your screen is 800 or more pixels wide
    (like mode 31) than numbers near 94 work best. You can switch this
    option off in case the (text only) output of AntiWord is intended to
    be the input of a wordprocessor or DTP program.

Q5: What does the 'Auto filetype' option do?
A5: When auto filetype is allowed, AntiWord will change the filetype of
    Wordfiles to MSWord (&ae6)

Q6: When AntiWord uses outline fonts it becomes horribly slow. What can I
    do about that?
A6: When AntiWord uses outline fonts it needs a large font cache. A small
    font cache wil make AntiWord (very) slow. The larger the font cache the
    better, but usualy 160K or 256K will do.

Q7: What is the purpose of the file 'FontNames' in the Choices directory?
A7: This file provides a translation tabel from the fontnames as they are
    found in a Word file to the fontnames as they are known to the RISC OS
    font-manager.
    The file 'FontNames' is user-editable to make it suit your collection
    of fonts. Some examples are provided in the Resources directory.

Q8: What is 'Hidden text'?
A8: Hidden text is Microsoft speak for text that will or will not be shown
    on the screen, subject to the users preferences, but such text is never
    printed.
