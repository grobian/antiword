Frequently Asked Questions (Unix version)
=========================================

Q1: How do I install antiword?
A1: (a) Make a suitable directory like '$HOME/src/antiword' and copy the
        'antiword.tar.gz' file to this directory.
    (b) decompress: 'gunzip antiword.tar.gz'
    (c) unpack: 'tar xvf antiword.tar'
    (d) compile: 'make all'
    (e) install: 'make install'. This will install antiword in the $HOME/bin
        directory.
    (f) copy one or more mapping files from the Resources directory to the
        $HOME/.antiword directory (note the dot before antiword!).

Q2: How do I use antiword?
A2: Type antiword -h and see.

Q3: How does antiword deal with Word macro viruses?
A3: Antiword does not run any Word macros because it can not do so.
    Therefore your computer system will not be harmed by such a virus.

Q4: What is the purpose of the file 'fontnames' in the '$HOME/.antiword'
    directory?
A4: This file provides a translation tabel from the fontnames as they are
    found in a Word file to the fontnames as they are known to a Postscript
    printer.
    The file 'fontnames' is user-editable to make it suit the collection
    of fonts on your Postscript printer.

Q5: What is 'Hidden text'?
A5: Hidden text is Microsoft speak for text that will or will not be shown
    on the screen, subject to the users preferences, but such text is never
    printed.

Q6: Antiword claims to support all ISO-8859 character sets, but I can't see
    any of this.
A6: There is support for all ISO-8859 character sets, but only in the text
    output, not in the PostScript output.
    The result can only be seen if your xterm, vtterm, kvt or similair
    terminal emulation program uses a font compatible with that ISO-8859
    character set.

Q7: What is the right mapping file (-m option) in my situation?
A7: The correct mapping file depends on the character set you need for a
    specific language.
    For languages from Western Europe (English, French, German) that will be
    mapping file 8859-1.txt.
    For languages from Eastern Europe (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Croatian) that
    will be mapping file 8859-2.txt. (When working under OS/2 you might also
    try mapping file cp1250.txt)
    For Esperanto that will be mapping file 8859-3.txt.
    For Russian that will be mapping file 8859-5.txt or koi8-r.txt. (When
    working under OS/2 you might also try mapping file cp1251.txt)
    For Hebrew that will be mapping file 8859-8.txt.
